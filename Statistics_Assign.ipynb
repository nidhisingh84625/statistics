    "Statistics is mainly divided into the following two categories. \n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics: In the descriptive Statistics, the Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data. \n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics: In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarised we use Inferential Statistics to describe the Meaning of the collected Data. \n",

    "Levels of measurement, also called scales of measurement, tell you how precisely variables are recorded. In scientific research, a variable is anything that can take on different values across your data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, There are 4 levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "1. Nominal Data: Nominal data is a type of data that consists of categories or names that cannot be ordered or ranked. Nominal data is often used to categorize observations into groups, and the groups are not comparable. In other words, nominal data has no inherent order or ranking. \n",
    "Examples of nominal data include gender (male/female), race (White/Black/Asian), religion (Christianity/Islam/Judaism), and blood type (A/B/AB/O).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal Data: Ordinal data is a type of data that consists of categories that can be ordered or ranked. However, the distance between categories is not necessarily equal. Ordinal data is often used to measure subjective attributes or opinions, where there is a natural order to the responses. \n",
    "Examples of ordinal data include education level (elementary/middle/high school/college), job position (manager/supervisor/employee), and Likert scales (strongly agree/agree/disagree/strongly disagree).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval Data: Interval data is a type of data that consists of numerical values where the distance between each value is equal. However, there is no true zero point. Interval data is often used to measure attributes such as temperature, dates, and time. \n",
    "Examples of interval data include temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit), dates (days/months/years), and time (hours/minutes/seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ratio Data: Ratio data is a type of data that has a true zero point and an equal distance between each value. Ratio data is considered the most informative type of data because it can be used to make meaningful comparisons and calculations. In addition, ratio data can be used to perform all types of statistical analyses.\n",
    "Examples of ratio data include height (inches/centimeters), weight (pounds/kilograms), income (dollars), and distance (miles/kilometers). For instance, if someone’s height is 60 inches, it means that they are 5 feet tall, and if their height is 72 inches, it means that they are 6 feet tall."
